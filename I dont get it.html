            <p>Welcome to my fun page</p>
            <h1>This page is about all of my complaints about my company!</h1>
            <p class="tiny"> I have been working in the plumbing industry for about a year now,
                 I have seen it all with this industry and I feel like I am about to discover more.
                I was pretty naive to think that it would be all rainbows and unicorns. 
                I knew the industry would have its pros and cons but after getting some hand's on experience,
                 I am pretty shocked.
                The amount of greed and selfishness in the industry is very eye-opening.
                 These plumbers are getting paid commision and the competition is fierce! 
                The workers here are quick to throw other people under the bus and they are very paranoid about how they look to the boss. 
                I noticed that people are scared to say
                what they really want to say or think. 
                They even bait other people into saying some stuff so they can go snitch. With that being said this experience has been a difficult one. 
                I learned not to trust anybody.
            </p>
       <h2><strong>Pros!</strong></h2>
       <ul>
           <li>Learn a lot</li>
           <li>Learn while getting paid</li>
           <li>Paid training</li>
           <li>Free schooling</li>
       </ul>

       <p class="tiny">While having all these pros may be attractive, I can not help but feel like being exploited on many occasions. 
           It honestly feels like all these PROS are to benefit the owner and not myself. 
           The discernment I got from being here was that they make it look like they are all about helping me but really it is helping themselves.
           I am here to make the plumbers works easier which is understandable but also they do not care if I am being abused by them. 
           I got mistreated so many times that I wanted to fight somebody. 
           The amount of negativitiy I experienced was alarming. They really only care about revenue. 
       </p>

       <h2><strong>Cons!</strong></h2>
       <ul>
           <li>Favoritism</li>
           <li>Racism</li>
           <li>Competition</li>
           <li>Exploitation</li>
           <li>Used</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="tiny">You may think the pros outweight the con and I feel like that to sometimes but it is not a good feeling experiencing all these traits.
            I lose confidence in staying at a company that allows all this to happen. In my opinion it trickles down from the top dog. If the leader of the company 
        is not like this then no one would be like this in the company. The competition con is very understandable but it is so unhealthy when the workers feel the need 
        to rat each other and make others looks bad to make themselves look good to the boss. While telling the boss of some things is necessary for the health of the company but to 
        manipulate the boss into thinking someones bad because you do not like them is not good! I have been a victim of this many times. If the boss takes care of this and does not 
        allow this to happen then it will not happen! In my opinion he allows it to happen for whatever reason. I have seen it happen many times. 
        </p>

        <p class="tiny"> My time at this industry has been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of false promises to string me along for the ride. I am doing a lot of hard thinking to see if I 
            even want to be in this type of industry. Is it worth it to make good money and be emotionally hurt? I seen it with many workers here they are always on edge and paranoid. 
            I can tell it is hard for them emotionally when rampant favortisim is going on. They get breadcrumbed good jobs and they get hurt when others get better jobs. I do not want to sign up for this. 
            It will be hard enough working a physically demanding job.
